Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

This project is a part of the Codecademy course, where you build your own basic design system for a website. The goal is to create a foundation for future web design projects by organizing colors, fonts, and common styles.

Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to develop a design system that will serve as a toolkit for building future websites. You'll consolidate reusable design components such as:

* Color palette
* Typography (fonts, sizes, and styles)
* Spacing (margins, paddings, and layout)
